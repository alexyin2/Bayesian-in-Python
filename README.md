# Bayesian in Machine Learning using Python
* This is a practice of helping me to learn the background mathematics in Bayesian.
* I'll write down anything that I've learned and thought it was important in this procedure. 
* This practice is based on [LazyProgrammer.me](https://github.com/lazyprogrammer)

## A/B test
1. We need to know what t test means in statistics. I'll suggest [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test)
2. Bonferroni Correction. I'll suggest [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction)
3. There is always a question that bothers me since I've learned p-value. THis is a sentence quoted from a paper: **_If such hypothesis is not rejected, it is usually because the sample size is too small(Nunnally 1960)_**
